# Discord Integrations

This is a collection of various helpful Discord integrations I have written.

## Live Version

These integrations can be viewed in my [Discord Server](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com). Want to [run it yourself?](https://docs.nhcarrigan.com/#/discord-integrations/usage)

## Integrations

Here is a brief description of each integration.

### Twitter Monitor

This is a monitor which checks the Twitter API for recent tweets and sends them to a Discord webhook as an embed.

### Wakatime Monitor

This is a monitor which checks the Wakatime API daily to get the previous day's stats, and compiles them into an embed to post to Discord.

### Uptime Monitor

This is a custom middleware which recieves POST events from Uptime Robot, parses the data into an embed, and passes it to a Discord webhook.
