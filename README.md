## Integrations

Here is a brief description of each integration.

### Twitter Monitor

This is a monitor which checks the Twitter API for recent tweets and sends them to a Discord webhook as an embed.

### Wakatime Monitor

This is a monitor which checks the Wakatime API daily to get the previous day's stats, and compiles them into an embed to post to Discord.
